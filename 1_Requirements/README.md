# Requirements
##  Features
  * Easy way to monitoring the car.
  * Check the Car Engines Temperature using Temperature Sensor.
  * Buzzer will ON, if the Car Engine is in Danger.
  * To avoid accidents by providing signals to the user by providing Ultrasonic Sensor.

## Research
  * Referred to many Arduino Ultrasonic-based projects and Analog Input Based projects.
  * Referred many e-sources for the coding part of LCD.
       
##  Key features
  * Measuring the obstacle distance.

# The 4W's and an H 

## WHAT
  * It is the controlling the pulses of Ultrasonic Transducer and ENgines Temperature.
## WHY
  * To Check the Car Engine Temperature is in Normal Degree and also the obstacles.
## WHO
  * Person, who drive or going long journey make the vehicle runs properly.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use for driving four-wheelers and six-wheelers.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using the "Embedded C Program" based on AVR programming.

# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
   * Easily Operating.
   * Monitoring continously.
   * Platform Independent.
 ## WEAKNESS:
   * Controlling using WEB.
 ## THREATS:
   * For long distances, it can't find the distance of the obstacles.
