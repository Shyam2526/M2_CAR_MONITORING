# The 4W's and an H 

## WHAT
  * It is the controlling of Ultrasonic Sensor to find the distance.
## WHY
  * The main objective of this project is to avoid accidents by giving led signals.
## WHO
  * Youngsters who drive cars for the initial stages.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use for driving four-wheelers and six-wheelers.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using the "Embedded C Program" based on AVR programming.
