# Requirements
##  Feautures
  * Easy to find the obstacles.
  * To avoid accidents by providing signals to the user.
  * Automatic controlling using ultrasonic.

## Research
  * Referred many Arduino Ultrasonic based projects.
  * Referred many e-sources for coding part of LCD.
       
##  Key feautures
  * Measuring the obstacle distance.

# The 4W's and a H 

## WHAT
  * It is the controlling of Ultrasonic Sensor to find distance.
## WHY
  * The main objective of this project is to avoid accidents by giving led signals.
## WHO
  * Youngesters who driving cars for the initial stages.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use at driving four wheelers and six wheelers.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "Embedded C Program" based on AVR programming.

# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
   * Easily Operating.
   * Platform Independant.
 ## WEAKNESS:
   * Controlling using WEB.
 ## THREATS:
   * For long distance, it can't be find the distance of the obstacles.
