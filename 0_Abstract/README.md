# ABSTRACT

* This project "CAR MONITORING" is about avoiding accidents before providing a led signal using an ultrasonic sensor. 
* The ultrasonic sensor is trigged and echoed by atmega328 D0 and D2 pins. LCD is used to display the obstacle distance. 
* The LCD connections are given to the atmega328 for displaying the values. 
* Trigger PIN is used to trigger the sensor to measure the distance, the distance is calculated by the pulse. 
* The pulse is changed every time when the ultrasonic sensor is activated. When the sensor has moved the distance that the sensor moved is displayed. 
* LED is also connected to show the sensor working properly, if the sensor is on the LED will glow.
