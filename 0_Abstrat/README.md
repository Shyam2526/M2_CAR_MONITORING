# ABSTRACT

```bash
This project "CAR MONITORING" is about avoid the accident before providing led signal using ultrasonic sensor. Ultrasonic sensor is trigged and echoed by atmega328 D0 and D2 pins. LCD is used to display the obstacle distance. The LCD connections are given to the atmega328 for displaying the values. Trigger PIN is used tp trigger the sensor to measure the distance, the distance is calculated by the pulse. The pulse is changed every time when the ultrasonic sensor is activated. When the sensor is moved the distance that the sensor moved is displayed. LED is also connected to show the sensor working properly, if the sensor is on the LED will glow.
