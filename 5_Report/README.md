# CAR MONITORING
## ABSTRACT

## INTRODUCTION
  * Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human interference through the use of technological or mechanical devices. It is the technique of making a process or a system operate automatically.
  * Car Monitoring consists of an electronic device or number of devices installed in a vehicle to monitor driver activities and to find obstalces opposite to the car.

## COMPONENTS USED
  1) Atmega328
  2) Ultrasoic Sensor
  3) LCD Display
  4) LED
  5) Resistor (10k ohm)

## COMPONENTS DISCRIPTION
* ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory. ATmega328 has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).
* An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity.
* LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
* LEDs are “directional” light sources, which means they emit light in a specific direction, unlike incandescent and CFL, which emit light and heat in all directions. That means LEDs are able to use light and energy more efficiently in a multitude of applications.
## WORKING
* This project is mainly based on the ultrasonic sensor, which measures the distance to an object.
* Using transducer, the ultrasonic sensor sends the wave and receive the ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity. 
* The pulses are vary by the object that near the vehicles. The pulses are divided by some values(52) to get approximate distances.
* It depends on the obstacles, the led will glow, which is connected with the resistor to avoid short circuit. 
* The connections are made as per the circuit diagram before.

## CONCLUSION
        In this project, the distance is measured by using ultrasonic sensor to avoid the accidents of vehiles.
